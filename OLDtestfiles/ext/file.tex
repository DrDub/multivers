\section{Solving equations}
\label{sec:solving_equations}

Most math skills boil down to being able to manipulate and solve equations. 
Solving an equation means finding the value of the unknown in the equation.

Check this \pgt{}{shit} out:
\[
 x^2-4=45.
\]
To solve the above equation is to answer
the question ``What is $x$?''
More precisely, we want to find the number that can take the 
place of $x$ in the equation so that the equality holds.
In other words, we're asking,
\[
  \text{``Which number times itself minus four gives 45?''}
\]
That is quite a mouthful, don't you think? 
To remedy this verbosity, mathematicians often use specialized mathematical symbols.  
The problem is that these specialized symbols can be very confusing. 
Sometimes even the simplest math concepts are inaccessible if you don't know what the symbols mean.
