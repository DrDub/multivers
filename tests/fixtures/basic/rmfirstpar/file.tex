\section{Solving equations}
\label{sec:solving_equations}

To solve the above equation is to answer the question ``What is $x$?''
More precisely,
we want to find the number that can take the place of $x$ in the equation so that the equality holds.
In other words, we're asking,
\[
  \text{``Which number times itself minus four gives 45?''}
\]
That is quite a mouthful, don't you think?
To remedy this verbosity, mathematicians often use specialized mathematical symbols.
The problem is that these specialized symbols can be very confusing.
Sometimes even the simplest math concepts are inaccessible if you don't know what the symbols mean.
